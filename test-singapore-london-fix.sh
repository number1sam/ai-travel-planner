echo "🐛 THE ISSUE WAS:"
echo "   Conversation ending when user says 'London' as departure city"
echo "   Root cause: React state management issue with detectedDestination"
echo ""

echo "🔧 THE FIX:"
echo "   1. Enhanced state preservation using updatedPlan.destination fallback"
echo "   2. Added comprehensive debugging logs"
echo "   3. Used currentDestination = detectedDestination || updatedPlan.destination"
echo "   4. Updated all references to use consistent state"

echo "🧪 TEST THE EXACT SEQUENCE:"
echo ""
echo "Step 1: Type 'i would like to go to Singapore'"
echo "        Expected: Singapore info with landmarks (Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay)"
echo "        Expected: 'When would you like to travel to Singapore? Also, which city will you be departing from?'"
echo ""

echo "Step 2: Type 'london'"
echo "        Expected: 'Great! Flying from London to Singapore. ✈️"
echo "                   When would you like to travel? You can mention specific dates...'"
echo ""

echo "Step 3: Type 'June 15-22'"
echo "        Expected: 'Excellent! So you're planning to fly from London to Singapore around June 15. ✈️"
echo "                   How many people will be traveling?'"
echo ""

echo "Step 4: Type '2 people'"
echo "        Expected: 'Great! What's your approximate budget for this trip to Singapore?'"
echo ""

echo "Step 5: Continue conversation to completion"
echo "        Expected: Full travel plan generation with flights and hotels"
echo ""

echo "❌ WHAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN:"
echo "   • Conversation ending after 'london'"
echo "   • 'I'd love to help you plan your trip! Could you tell me which destination...'"
echo "   • Any loops or restarts"
echo ""

echo "✅ DEBUGGING FEATURES:"
echo "   • Console logs showing state preservation"
echo "   • Condition checks for flow logic"
echo "   • Origin city detection verification"

echo "💡 KEY IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "   • Better React state management"
echo "   • Fallback to plan.destination when detectedDestination is lost"
echo "   • Comprehensive debugging for future issues"
echo "   • Consistent variable usage throughout conversation flow"
